# AI-based-cancer-deduction-project
Early cancer detection using AI and machine learning. Built and evaluated Logistic Regression and Decision Tree models with data preprocessing, feature analysis, and performance metrics to enable accurate and reliable medical predictions.

This project evaluates the effectiveness of supervised machine learning algorithms for early-stage cancer prediction using structured medical data. Two classification models  Logistic Regression and Decision Tree Classifier  were implemented, trained, and compared to assess their predictive performance and suitability for medical decision support systems.

The Logistic Regression model achieved an overall accuracy of 91.23%, demonstrating strong generalization on unseen test data. The model showed exceptionally high precision for the cancer class, indicating a low false-positive rate, which is critical in medical diagnostics to avoid unnecessary anxiety and interventions. Additionally, the model performed extremely well in identifying non-cancer cases, highlighting its robustness in class separation.

The Decision Tree model slightly outperformed Logistic Regression with an accuracy of 92.10%. It delivered a more balanced precision-recall tradeoff and achieved higher recall for cancer cases, making it particularly effective for early detection scenarios where minimizing false negatives is essential. The tree-based approach also provides interpretability, allowing insights into feature importance and decision rules used during classification.

Overall, the comparative analysis shows that both models are capable of delivering reliable predictions for cancer diagnosis. The results validate the potential of machine learning techniques to assist clinicians by providing accurate, interpretable, and data-driven insights for early cancer detection.
